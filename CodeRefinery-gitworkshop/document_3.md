# Document 3

*A personal reflection for each of the 6 days written as a document (pdf or word or txt, one paragraph per day). To get started, you can try answering the questions: "Why is this important? How can it improve my research work?" However any other personal reflection is welcome. Evaluation criteria: we expect reflections that are related to the content of each of the six days.*

1. Reproducible research is more than developing packages. Snakemake, what is this thing. Packages plus code flow recording it is DATA and Conection. For complete reproducibility needs the git. Environment in R could use conda. COntainers are challenge to install, many problems in the past. Care about reproducibility.

2. Social code: Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.be carefull about what is a derivative.
